    <p class="game-description"> 
       A solar storm is like a giant eruption from the Sun. It launches a large amount of PARTICLES , ENERGY , and material into space.
When this eruption comes toward Earth, it disrupts our planet's magnetic field, causing a GEOMAGNETIC STORM.
The effects can include:  <br> <br>
‚Ä¢	BLACKOUTS in radio and power grids. <br>
‚Ä¢	Stunning AURORAS in the sky. <br>
‚Ä¢	A bright flash of light called a SOLAR FLARE. <br>
‚Ä¢	A RADIATION STORM , or a wave of solar particles launched into space at high speed. <br> 
‚Ä¢	A massive cloud of solar material, called a CORONAL MASS EJECTION (CME) , that moves away from the Sun. <br> 
But don't worry: Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field act like a shield, protecting us from any direct harm. <br><br>
What causes all this? The Sun has magnetic fields that twist and stretch, like rubber bands. When they break and reconnect, they release a huge amount of energy, creating the storm.
